# Advent Of Code 2017

Here are my solutions for the [Advent Of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017) problems. All of the code is written with [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.github.io/) and love. Every problem has **unit tests**, **documentation** and function **type specs**.

## Running unit tests

```
mix test
```
